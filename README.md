clickclackclickclackclickclack Xel opens his eyes to see... nothing. Less than void, just literall nothing. Clear and dark. He struggles to get to his feet, 
but he felt like like maybe he was already standing? Was he laying down? "HELLO!?" Xel cries despretly. Click click click click. 
Loud thunderous clicks resonate from the nowhere. Before Xel a chair, a desk, and a strange man appear before Xel. clickclackclickc
lackclickclack "Who are you?" Xel asked flabbergasted. The man smiles and turns to his desk. A keyboard appears he begins typing. 
clickclackclickclackclickclack. Clearly this is the source of that strange noise. The man finshes typing and gets up. "I am your creator."
he says. "I made you." "So, you're my father?" Xel asked. The man smiles and moves back to the keyboard. clickclack "I made him too Xel, 
I made you're world, your life." Xel noticed that the words we're not coming from the man. They just were coming to him. A stream of words
that he was bathing in. "I don't understand. Are you saying you made me up? Just out of your imagination?" Xel struggles with this for a 
moment. "I feel things. I feel real! How can I just be made up?!" The man smiles calmly. clickclack "You are real Xel, as long as people
believe in you and see you as an inspiration, as a hero you will always be real. I can't take that from you now. Once you were born from 
my pregnant mind and other people read about your life and adventures you became real and as long as they believe in you, will never die."
Xel now looking very concerned. "But... I did die. Oherwise I wouldn't be here." he says. "You're here because this is the beggening and 
the end. This is what I've written.

Open on a blank computer monitor. The computer boots up. 
Monitor l.e.d goes from amber to birght white. Motherboard splash screen. Operating system log in screen. An icon with Max's picture shows up. He's wearing white headphones over the ear and has a green screen behind him.

The password field gets filled. The Mouse cursor opens an application called Jolt.tv   He types "Samurai" in to the search bar. 

Samurai's channel comes up. Under currently playing it reads "Two-Weaks". The channel is clicked on and opened. 

	SAMURAI
Hey! Thanks for the 12 month sub Buggerlord! I truly appreciated. LETS GET SOME KATANA KUTS in the chat for bugger people! 


The chat fills with emoji of a Katana cutting the word Kut. Max types a couple himself. The loading screen for Two-Weaks comes up on Samurai's screen. 

	SAMURAI
Woo, lets go for that Bacon breakfast guys! 

	MAX (O.S.)
Oh my jeeze, she's so cool! 

Int. Max's Room, Afternoon. 
Max's room is tidy enough. There are gaming posters all over the walls and shelves with action figures and statuettes. Josh Max's best friend is standing behind him watching the screen. 

	JOSH
I don't get it. So you watch her... play video games? 

Max Swings his chair around.

	MAX
No, no no no no, She's literally one of the best at Two-Weaks.  

	JOSH
I mean she's really good, but I just don't get how you can 
just watch someone play games for hours. Like, whats stopping you from doing what she does? 

Those words. Max is stunned at those words. His eyes glaze over and he beings to day dream. 

Int. Max's mind. Day Dream. 

Max is playing Two-Weaks activly. A second monitor has appeared on his desk. That monitor shows his streaming program. He gets a notification of a new follower, we see his follower count grow and grow. Sub count grow and grow. His room changes around him to bigger and better gaming gear. He gets a DM on Jolt.tv from SAMURAI. It reads. "Hey maybe we should do a stream together sometime?" He imagines playing Two-Weaks with her, then she's sitting next to him in his room. They get married all live streamed. 

	JOSH (O.S.)
Max! Max! Nik is here to pick us up. MAX! 

INT. Max's Room Afternoon. 

MAx snaps out of his day dream. EXTREAMLY EXCITED. He jumps out of his chair and pounces on to JOSH. 

	MAX
JOSH! YOU'RE RIGHT IT WHAT IS STOPPING ME FROM DOING WHAT SHE DOES?! LITERALLY NOTHING. I'M GOING TO START TONIGHT! I'm going to be the TOP STREAMER!
