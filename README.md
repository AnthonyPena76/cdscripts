clickclackclickclackclickclack Xel opens his eyes to see... nothing. Less than void, just literall nothing. Clear and dark. He struggles to get to his feet, 
but he felt like like maybe he was already standing? Was he laying down? "HELLO!?" Xel cries despretly. Click click click click. 
Loud thunderous clicks resonate from the nowhere. Before Xel a chair, a desk, and a strange man appear before Xel. clickclackclickc

he says. "I made you." "So, you're my father?" Xel asked. The man smiles and moves back to the keyboard. clickclack "I made him too Xel, 
I made you're world, your life." Xel noticed that the words we're not coming from the man. They just were coming to him. A stream of words
that he was bathing in. "I don't understand. Are you saying you made me up? Just out of your imagination?" Xel struggles with this for a 
moment. "I feel things. I feel real! How can I just be made up?!" The man smiles calmly. clickclack "You are real Xel, as long as people
believe in you and see you as an inspiration, as a hero you will always be real. I can't take that from you now. Once you were born from 
my pregnant mind and other people read about your life and adventures you became real and as long as they believe in you, will never die."
Xel now looking very concerned. "But... I did die. Oherwise I wouldn't be here." he says. "You're here because this is the beggening and 
the end. This is what I've written.
